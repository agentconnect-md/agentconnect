 * cluster mode and a hosted deployment run this same path — only the policy
 * inputs (the defaults below) differ.

 * Nothing here reconciles on a timer: the operator is level-triggered and
 * re-reads the CR on its own resync, so the control plane only has to make the
 * spec true at the moment it changes.
